\begin{abstract}
\textit{Background:} In the context of software development, \GH has been at the forefront of platforms to
%gained a valuable role in 
store, analyze and maintain a large number of software repositories. Topics have been introduced by \GH as an effective 
method to 
annotate stored repositories. However, labeling GitHub repositories should be 
carefully conducted to avoid adverse effects on project popularity and 
reachability.
\textit{Aims:} We present \TF, a novel approach to assist open source 
software developers in selecting suitable topics for GitHub repositories being 
created.
\textit{Method:} We built a project-topic matrix and applied a syntactic-based 
similarity 
function to recommend missing topics by representing repositories and related 
topics in a graph. %-based manner. 
The ten-fold cross-validation methodology has 
been used to assess the performance of \TF by considering different 
metrics, \ie success rate, precision, recall, and catalog coverage.
\textit{Result:} The results show that \TF recommends good topics 
depending on different factors, \ie collaborative filtering settings, 
considered datasets, and pre-processing activities. Moreover, \TF can be combined with a state-of-the-art topic recommender system (\ie MNB 
network) to improve the overall prediction performance.
\textit{Conclusion:} Our results confirm that collaborative filtering 
techniques can successfully be used to provide relevant topics for GitHub 
repositories. Moreover, \TF can gain a significant boost in prediction 
performances by employing the outcomes obtained by the MNB network as its 
initial set of topics.

%%Collaborative filtering is a well-founded technique widely used in the 
%%recommendation system domain. 
%$\blacksquare$~\textbf{Background} 
%%In recent years, a plethora of approaches have been developed to provide the 
%%users with relevant items. 
%In the context of software development, \GH has gained a precious role in 
%storing, analyzing and maintaining a considerable number of repositories.
%% In the recent years, \GH introduced the possibility to classify them 
%%employing topics to represent the stored projects in an effective manner.   
%Topics have been introduced by \GH as an effective manner to annotate stored 
%repositories. However,
%% to increase their reachability and help developers when they are 
%%searching for existing software artifacts satisfying their needs.  However,
%labeling \GH repositories should be carefully conducted to avoid 
%adverse effects on project popularity and reachability.
%%$\blacksquare$~\textbf{Aims}  In this paper, we present \CT, a recommender 
%%system to assist open source software developers in selecting suitable topics 
%%for the repositories. \CT exploits a collaborative filtering technique to 
%%recommend topics to developers by relying on the set of initial ones, which 
%%are 
%%currently included in the project being.

%%\CT exploits a collaborative filtering technique to recommend topics to 
%%developers by relying on the set of initial ones, which are currently 
%%included 
%%in the project being. 
%$\blacksquare$~\textbf{Method} We built a user-item matrix and applied a 
%syntactic-based similarity function to recommend missing topics by 
%representing 
%repositories and related topics in a graph-based manner. 
%%To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that uses 
%%collaborative filtering technique for recommending useful topics to a \GH 
%%repository. At which point, 
%The \emph{ten-fold cross-validation} methodology has been used to assess the 
%performance of \CT by considering different metrics, \ie precision, recall, 
%and 
%catalog coverage.
%%we validated the approach by considering different metrics, aiming to study 
%%various quality aspects (\ie which \CT parameters provide better prediction 
%%performance)., 
%$\blacksquare$~\textbf{Result} The results show how \CT recommends good topics 
%depending on different factors, \ie collaborative filtering settings, 
%considered 
%datasets and pre-processing activities. Moreover, we show how \CT  can be 
%combined with an existing topic recommender systems (\ie \MNB) to improve 
%the 
%initial overall prediction performances. 
%$\blacksquare$~\textbf{Conclusion}
%Our results confirm that collaborative filtering techniques can be 
%successfully 
%used to recommend relevant topics for \GH repositories. Moreover, \TF 
%can 
%gain a significant boost in prediction performances by employing the \MNB 
%outcomes as input topics.
