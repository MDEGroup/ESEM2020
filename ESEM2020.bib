	abstract="Recommendation agents employ prediction algorithms to provide users with items that match their interests. In this paper, we describe and evaluate several prediction algorithms, some of which are novel in that they combine user-based and item-based similarity measures derived from either explicit or implicit ratings. We compare both statistical and decision-support accuracy metrics of the algorithms against different levels of data sparsity and different operational thresholds. The first metric evaluates the accuracy in terms of average absolute deviation, while the second evaluates how effectively predictions help users to select high-quality items. Our experimental results indicate better performance of item-based predictions derived from explicit ratings in relation to both metrics. Category-boosted predictions can lead to slightly better predictions when combined with explicit ratings, while implicit ratings (in the sense that we have defined them here) perform much worse than explicit ratings.",

	abstract = "Modern software systems are increasingly dependent on third-party libraries. It is widely recognized that using mature and well-tested third-party libraries can improve developers’ productivity, reduce time-to-market, and produce more reliable software. Today’s open-source repositories provide a wide range of libraries that can be freely downloaded and used. However, as software libraries are documented separately but intended to be used together, developers are unlikely to fully take advantage of these reuse opportunities. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically identify third-party library usage patterns, i.e., collections of libraries that are commonly used together by developers. Our approach employs a hierarchical clustering technique to group together software libraries based on external client usage. To evaluate our approach, we mined a large set of over 6000 popular libraries from Maven Central Repository and investigated their usage by over 38,000 client systems from the Github repository. Our experiments show that our technique is able to detect the majority (77%) of highly consistent and cohesive library usage patterns across a considerable number of client systems."

A recommender system is one of the major techniques that handle information overload problem of Information Retrieval by suggesting users with appropriate and relevant items. Today, several recommender systems have been developed for different domains however, these are not precise enough to fulfil the information needs of users. Therefore, it is necessary to build high quality recommender systems. In designing such recommenders, designers face several issues and challenges that need proper attention. This paper investigates and reports the current trends, issues, challenges, and research opportunities in developing high-quality recommender systems. If properly followed, these issues and challenges will introduce new research avenues and the goal towards fine-tuned and high-quality recommender systems can be achieved.",

	abstract = {Abstract Recommender systems have developed in parallel with the web. They were initially based on demographic, content-based and collaborative filtering. Currently, these systems are incorporating social information. In the future, they will use implicit, local and personal information from the Internet of things. This article provides an overview of recommender systems as well as collaborative filtering methods and algorithms; it also explains their evolution, provides an original classification for these systems, identifies areas of future implementation and develops certain areas selected for past, present or future importance. },

Participants were requested to address the tasks by means of recommendation approaches that made use of Linked Open Data and semantic technologies. In the chapter we describe the challenge motivation, goals and tasks, summarize and compare the nine final participant recommendation approaches, and discuss their experimental results and lessons learned. Finally, we end with some conclusions and potential lines of future research.",

This paper proposes to build open recommender systems which can utilise Linked Data to mitigate the new-user, new-item and sparsity problems of collaborative recommender systems. We describe how to aggregate data about object centred sociality from different sources and how to process it for collaborative recommendation. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we augment the data from a closed collaborative music recommender system with Linked Data, and significantly improve its precision and recall.},

Content-based recommendation systems may be used in a variety of domains ranging from recommending web pages, news articles, restaurants, television programs, and items for sale. Although the details of various systems differ, content-based recommendation systems share in common a means for describing the items that may be recommended, a means for creating a profile of the user that describes the types of items the user likes, and a means of comparing items to the user profile to determine what to re commend. The profile is often created and updated automatically in response to feedback on the desirability of items that have been presented to the user.",

	abstract="The popularity and utility of smartphones rely on their vibrant application markets; however, plagiarism threatens the long-term health of these markets. We present a scalable approach to detecting similar Android apps based on their semantic information. We implement our approach in a tool called AnDarwin and evaluate it on 265,359 apps collected from 17 markets including Google Play and numerous thirdparty markets. In contrast to earlier approaches, AnDarwin has four advantages: it avoids comparing apps pairwise, thus greatly improving its scalability; it analyzes only the app code and does not rely on other information - such as the app's market, signature, or description - thus greatly increasing its reliability; it can detect both full and partial app similarity; and it can automatically detect library code and remove it from the similarity analysis. We present two use cases for AnDarwin: finding similar apps by different developers (``clones'') and similar apps from the same developer (``rebranded''). In ten hours, AnDarwin detected at least 4,295 apps that have been the victims of cloning and 36,106 apps that are rebranded. By analyzing the clusters found by AnDarwin, we found 88 new variants of malware and identified 169 malicious apps based on differences in the requested permissions. Our evaluation demonstrates AnDarwin's ability to accurately detect similar apps on a large scale.",

	abstract = {Fast and high-quality document clustering algorithms play an important role in providing intuitive navigation and browsing mechanisms by organizing large amounts of information into a small number of meaningful clusters. In particular, clustering algorithms that build meaningful hierarchies out of large document collections are ideal tools for their interactive visualization and exploration as they provide data-views that are consistent, predictable, and at different levels of granularity. This paper focuses on document clustering algorithms that build such hierarchical solutions and (i) presents a comprehensive study of partitional and agglomerative algorithms that use different criterion functions and merging schemes, and (ii) presents a new class of clustering algorithms called constrained agglomerative algorithms, which combine features from both partitional and agglomerative approaches that allows them to reduce the early-stage errors made by agglomerative methods and hence improve the quality of clustering solutions. The experimental evaluation shows that, contrary to the common belief, partitional algorithms always lead to better solutions than agglomerative algorithms; making them ideal for clustering large document collections due to not only their relatively low computational requirements, but also higher clustering quality. Furthermore, the constrained agglomerative methods consistently lead to better solutions than agglomerative methods alone and for many cases they outperform partitional methods, as well.},

Two variants of link-based similarity estimation between two nodes are described, one based on the separate local neighborhoods of the nodes, and another based on the joint local neighborhood expanded from both nodes at the same time. The algorithms are implemented and evaluated on a subgraph of the citation graph of computer science in a retrieval context. The results are compared with text-based similarity, and demonstrate the complementarity of link-based and text-based retrieval.",

@article{tversky1977features,
	abstract = {Questions the metric and dimensional assumptions that underlie the geometric representation of similarity on both theoretical and empirical grounds. A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance.

	abstract = {Linked Data promises an unprecedented availability of data on the Web. However, this vision comes together with the associated challenges of querying highly heterogeneous and distributed data. In order to query Linked Data on the Web today, end-users need to be aware of which datasets potentially contain the data and the data model behind these datasets. This query paradigm, deeply attached to the traditional perspective of structured queries over databases, does not suit the heterogeneity and scale of the Web, where it is impractical for data consumers to have an a priori understanding of the structure and location of available datasets. This work describes Treo, a best-effort natural language query mechanism for Linked Data, which focuses on the problem of bridging the semantic gap between end-user natural language queries and Linked Datasets.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for measuring semantic similarity/distance between words and concepts. It combines a lexical taxonomy structure with corpus statistical information so that the semantic distance between nodes in the semantic space constructed by the taxonomy can be better quantified with the computational evidence derived from a distributional analysis of corpus data. Specifically, the proposed measure is a combined approach that inherits the edge-based approach of the edge counting scheme, which is then enhanced by the node-based approach of the information content calculation. When tested on a common data set of word pair similarity ratings, the proposed approach outperforms other computational models. It gives the highest correlation value (r = 0.828) with a benchmark based on human similarity judgements, whereas an upper bound (r = 0.885) is observed when human subjects replicate the same task.},

Therefore, it is important both to software developers and users to compare and track the popularity of GitHub repositories. In this paper, we propose a framework to assess the popularity of GitHub software, using their number of stars. We also propose a set of popularity growth patterns, which describe the evolution of the number of stars of a system over time. We show that stars tend to correlate with other measures, like forks, and with the effective usage of GitHub software by third-party programs. Throughout the paper we illustrate the application of our framework using real data extracted from GitHub.},

For example, GitHub users can show appreciation to projects by adding stars to them. Therefore, the number of stars of a repository is a direct measure of its popularity. In this paper, we use multiple linear regressions to predict the number of stars of GitHub repositories. These predictions are useful both to repository owners and clients, who usually want to know how their projects are performing in a competitive open source development market. In a large-scale analysis, we show that the proposed models start to provide accurate predictions after being trained with the number of stars received in the last six months. Furthermore, specific models---generated using data from repositories that share the same growth trends---are recommended for repositories with slow growth and/or for repositories with less stars. Finally, we evaluate the ability to predict not the number of stars of a repository but its rank among the GitHub repositories. We found a very strong correlation between predicted and real rankings (Spearman's rho greater than 0.95).},

	abstract = {Besides a git-based version control system, GitHub integrates several social coding features. Particularly, GitHub users can star a repository, presumably to manifest interest or satisfaction with an open source project. However, the real and practical meaning of starring a project was never the subject of an in-depth and well-founded empirical investigation. Therefore, we provide in this paper a throughout study on the meaning, characteristics, and dynamic growth of GitHub stars. First, by surveying 791 developers, we report that three out of four developers consider the number of stars before using or contributing to a GitHub project. Then, we report a quantitative analysis on the characteristics of the top-5,000 most starred GitHub repositories. We propose four patterns to describe stars growth, which are derived after clustering the time series representing the number of stars of the studied repositories; we also reveal the perception of 115 developers about these growth patterns. To conclude, we provide a list of recommendations to open source project managers (e.g., on the importance of social media promotion) and to GitHub users and Software Engineering researchers (e.g., on the risks faced when selecting projects by GitHub stars).},
