\GH is one of the most used development services that includes version control 
systems (\ie git) plus social and collaborative features (\eg bug tracking, 
contribution requests, task management, and wikis).
At the time of writing this paper, \GH counts more than 40 million users and 
over 100 million repositories. Because of this enormous amount of data, the 
availability of reusable projects might be compromised if they cannot be 
suitably discovered. In recent years, \GH introduced a  mechanism based on 
topics to explore repositories. The managed \GH repositories are continuously 
monitored and assigned topics to improve their organisation. Moreover, 
repositories are periodically analysed to extract the most popular and active 
topics (\ie \emph{featured topics\footnote{\url{https://github.com/topics}}}). 
Thus, users can monitor the community's trend by consulting such a public list. 
In the beginning, this activity was entirely done by humans (\ie project 
contributors) that label the repository according to their knowledge, feeling 
and belief. Literature is plenty of approaches that mine and exploit available 
data to analyse repositories. Nevertheless, few of them cope with the topic 
recommendation task, which can be crucial in the project's development initial 
phase. Figure \ref{fig:SpaceshipGenerator} shows an explanatory repository with 
related topics. By this simple snapshot, a \GH user can figure out that the 
\emph{SpaceshipGenerator}\footnote{\label{note:spaceship}\url{https://github.com/a1studmuffin/SpaceshipGenerator}}
 repository makes use of \emph{Blender-scripts} (\ie a \emph{python} 3d 
modeling library) for \emph{procedural-generation} of \emph{3d} spaceships from 
a random seed.

As previously mentioned, the \MNB approach takes as input \RM file of a given 
repository to recommend the related featured topics, which can be assigned to 
it. To conceive  \MNB authors have adopted standard techniques employed in the 
ML domain \ie textual engineering, feature extraction, and training phase. By 
relying on the multinomial probability distribution, the approach can extract 
relevant information from the \RM file and suggest a set of topics. Table 
\ref{tab:example} shows an example of the outcomes obtained by \MNB given the list of the actual repository topics.

     game-development, 3d        &  
  shell, terminal, \textbf{3d},    opengl,    \textbf{python}        \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
}

Even though the \MNB works in practice, it suffers some limitations. First, the 
underlying model can recommend only featured topics that represent only a small 
set of all possible terms that can be potentially assigned to the analysed 
repository.
% that can be restricted because of antonymous term(\eg programming %languages).
%
For instance, \emph{blender-scripts}\footnote{blender is the most used python 
library to manipulate 3d objects. \url{https://www.blender.org/}} as well as 
\emph{game-development} could be recommended as possible topics because the 
project includes both \emph{3d} and \emph{python} topics.
In this way, the \MNB doesn't express all the concepts covered by a \GH 
repository. As shown in the table, only two of the predicted topics matched 
with the real ones. Moreover, in the case the repository already includes all 
suggested topics, \MNB is not able to recommend new ones.
The second major limitation is the underlying structure needed for the training 
phase. The \MNB requires a \emph{balanced} dataset to deliver relevant items, 
\ie each topic must have a similar number of  \RM files. Such a constraint is 
challenging to satisfy in practice as topics are generally heterogeneous. 
Furthermore, repositories in \GH are regularly updated with new topics, and 
thus, the training phase must take place several times to avoid outdated 
recommendations. 

In recent years, many techniques have been conceived to predict user interests 
by relying on the preferences collected from other users. Such techniques can 
be classified as  \emph{content-based}~\cite{Pazzani2007} where the 
relationships among items have been exploited to predict the most similar items,
or \emph{collaborative-filtering}~\cite{Miranda:2008:ICF:1486927.1487083} that 
calculates the missing ratings by taking into account the set of items rated by 
similar customers. There are two main types of collaborative-filtering 
recommendation: \emph{user-based} \cite{Zhao:2010:UCR:1748610.1749278} and 
\emph{item-based} \cite{Sarwar:2001:ICF:371920.372071} techniques. The former 
computes missing ratings by considering the ratings collected from similar 
users, whereas, the latter performs the same task by using the similarities 
among items \cite{Cremonesi:2008:EMC:1468165.1468327}.

In the following, we show the proposed collaborative-filtering approach that 
can recommend missing topics for \GH repositories. We show how the accuracy of 
the proposed approach can be higher than that of \MNB.
