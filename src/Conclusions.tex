\GH is nowadays the most popular platform to handle and maintain OSS projects. 
Topics have been introduced in 2017 to promote the project's visibility on the 
platform. 
%Although a couple of works face the problem, there are additional challenges 
%to be faced. 
In this work, we presented \CT, a collaborative filtering based recommender 
system to suggest \GH topics.  By encoding repositories and related topics in a 
graph-based representation, we built a user-item matrix and apply a 
syntactic-based similarity function to predict missing topics. To assess the 
prediction performances, we compared \CT with a well-founded work based on an 
ML technique in terms of success rate and accuracy. The results show that \CT 
outperforms the opponent with a relevant improvement of the mentioned metrics. 
Furthermore, we combined the two approaches by taking as input in \TF, the 
output produced by \MNB. We shown that by means of such a combined usage of the 
approaches, it is possible to obtain a significant boost in topic predictions. 
Nevertheless, the accuracy didn't reach higher values in all the experimental 
settings. To our best knowledge, it depends on the similarity function used in 
the recommendation engine as well as on the heterogeneity of the dataset. Thus, 
we are planning to extend \CT by adding different degrees of similarity, \eg 
semantic analysis on topics. Moreover, we can enlarge the evaluation by 
considering other common metrics in the collaborative filtering domain such as 
sales diversity and novelty. All of this is planned as future work.
