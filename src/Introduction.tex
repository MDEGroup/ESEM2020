In recent years, the open source software (OSS) community 
makes a daily usage of open source repositories to 
contribute their work as well as to access to projects 
coming from other developers. \GH is one of the most 
well-known platforms that aggregate these projects and 
render possible the exchange of knowledge among the users.

In order to aid information discovery and help 
developers identify projects that can be of their interest, \GH introduced \emph{topics}. They are 
words used to characterize projects, which thus can be 
annotated by means of lists of words that summarize projects' features. Thanks 
to the availability of \emph{topics}, several applications are enabled, 
including the automated cataloguing of GitHub repositories \cite{davidlo1}, 
further than allowing developers to explore projects by type, technology, and 
more.

Assigning the right topics to \GH repositories is a crucial step that, if not 
properly done, can affect in a negative way their discoverability. In 
2017, \GH presented \textit{repo-topix}, a topic suggestion tool essentially 
based on information retrieval techniques \cite{noauthor_topic_nodate}. 
Although the mechanism works well so far and it is fully integrated in \GH, in our 
opinion there is still some room for improvement, e.g., in terms of the variety 
of the suggested topics, novel data analysis techniques, and the investigation of new recommendation strategies.
